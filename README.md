# Mayflash F500 Mixbox Panel
Vector files for a DIY mixbox arcade controller mod for Mayflash F500

ponoko_f500_mixbox_v1.svg - has rounded key edges
ponoko_f500_mixbox_v2.svg - has sharp key edges

These files are ready to be uploaded to Ponoko to be laser cut. 
Here is the configuration for ordering:

* Acrylic - Clear 
* 0.080 inches 
> (I used 0.118 inches, but found it to be too thick, 0.080 might be better, please report back if you used 0.080)
* P2 - 15.100 inches long x 15.100 inches wide 

You will also need new mounting screws:
* M3 x 12mm - Socket or Phillips head 
> (If you are using 0.118 thickness, I used M3 x 14mm instead)

# Notes
I have not tested cuts made with 2mm (0.080 inches) thickness. However, I recommend you to try out 2mm anyways because I have used 3mm (0.118 inches) and find that it bulges out of the top a little bit.

Originally, the stock front plexiglass is 3mm while the control panel is 2mm. But with these vector files, I have put both the plexiglass and the control panel onto the same sheet, so when you order on Ponoko, you save on costs by only ordering one sheet of plexiglass and not two of different thicknesses. If you want to be perfect, you can edit the vector file, seperate the control panel and front plexiglass into two files, then have them cut out on their own original thickness. 

Please report back if you do use 2mm (0.080) thickness for both cuts, I will change this readme based on the feedback you give me.
